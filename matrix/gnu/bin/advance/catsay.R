# Concatenate and Print
# Description
# Outputs the objects, concatenating the representations. 
# cat performs much less conversion than print.

# Usage
cat(2 , file = "/home/admin/guilecran-r-project/guile-rlang-preface/matrix/gnu/bin/pdf/Intermediate Statistics with R.pdf", sep = " ", fill = FALSE, labels = NULL,
    append = FALSE)


# Arguments
# ...	
# R objects (see ‘Details’ for the types of objects allowed).

# file	
# A connection, or a character string naming the file to print to. 
# If "" (the default), cat prints to the standard output connection, 
# the console unless redirected by sink. If it is "|cmd", the output 
# is piped to the command given by ‘cmd’, by opening a pipe connection.

# sep	
# a character vector of strings to append after each element.

# fill	
# a logical or (positive) numeric controlling how the output is broken 
# into successive lines. If FALSE (default), only newlines created 
# explicitly by "\n" are printed. Otherwise, the output is broken into 
# lines with print width equal to the option width if fill is TRUE, 
# or the value of fill if this is numeric. Linefeeds are only inserted 
# between elements, strings wider than fill are not wrapped. 
# Non-positive fill values are ignored, with a warning.

# labels	
# character vector of labels for the lines printed. 
# Ignored if fill is FALSE.

# append	
# logical. Only used if the argument file is the name of file 
# (and not a connection or "|cmd"). If TRUE output will be appended 
# to file; otherwise, it will overwrite the contents of file.

# Details
# cat is useful for producing output in user-defined functions. 
# It converts its arguments to character vectors, concatenates 
# them to a single character vector, appends the given sep = string(s) 
# to each element and then outputs them.

# No linefeeds are output unless explicitly requested by "\n" or 
# if generated by filling (if argument fill is TRUE or numeric).

# If file is a connection and open for writing it is written from 
# its current position. If it is not open, it is opened for the 
# duration of the call in "wt" mode and then closed again.

# Currently only atomic vectors and names are handled, together 
# with NULL and other zero-length objects (which produce no output). 
# Character strings are output ‘as is’ (unlike print.default which 
# escapes non-printable characters and backslash — use encodeString 
# if you want to output encoded strings using cat). Other types of 
# R object should be converted (e.g., by as.character or format) 
# before being passed to cat. That includes factors, which are 
# output as integer vectors.

# cat converts numeric/complex elements in the same way as print 
# (and not in the same way as as.character which is used by the 
# S equivalent), so options "digits" and "scipen" are relevant. 
# However, it uses the minimum field width necessary for each 
# element, rather than the same field width for all elements.


# Value
# None (invisible NULL).

# Note
# If any element of sep contains a newline character, 
# it is treated as a vector of terminators rather than 
# separators, an element being output after every vector 
# element and a newline after the last. Entries are 
# recycled as needed.

# Examples
iter <- stats::rpois(1, lambda = 10)
## print an informative message
cat("iteration = ", iter <- iter + 1, "\n")

## 'fill' and label lines:
cat(paste(letters, 100* 1:26), fill = TRUE, labels = paste0("{", 1:10, "}:"))
