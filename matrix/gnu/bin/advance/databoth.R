# Data Frames
# Description
# The function data.frame() creates data frames, tightly coupled collections 
# of variables which share many of the properties of matrices and of lists, 
# used as the fundamental data structure by most of R's modeling software.

# Usage
data.frame(x, row.names = NULL, check.rows = FALSE,
           check.names = TRUE, fix.empty.names = TRUE,
           stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

default.stringsAsFactors() # << this is deprecated !

# Arguments
# ...	
# these arguments are of either the form value or tag = value. 
# Component names are created based on the tag (if present) 
# or the deparsed argument itself.

# row.names	
# NULL or a single integer or character string specifying 
# a column to be used as row names, or a character or integer 
# vector giving the row names for the data frame.

# check.rows	
# if TRUE then the rows are checked for consistency 
# of length and names.

# check.names	
# logical. If TRUE then the names of the variables in the data 
# frame are checked to ensure that they are syntactically valid 
# variable names and are not duplicated. If necessary they are 
# adjusted (by make.names) so that they are.

# fix.empty.names	
# logical indicating if arguments which are “unnamed” 
# (in the sense of not being formally called as someName = arg) 
# get an automatically constructed name or rather name "". 
# Needs to be set to FALSE even when check.names is false 
# if "" names should be kept.

# stringsAsFactors	
# logical: should character vectors be converted to factors? 
# The ‘factory-fresh’ default has been TRUE previously but has 
# been changed to FALSE for R 4.0.0.

# Details
# A data frame is a list of variables of the same number of rows 
# with unique row names, given class "data.frame". If no variables 
# are included, the row names determine the number of rows.

# The column names should be non-empty, and attempts to use empty 
# names will have unsupported results. Duplicate column names are 
# allowed, but you need to use check.names = FALSE for data.frame 
# to generate such a data frame. However, not all operations on 
# data frames will preserve duplicated column names: for example 
# matrix-like subsetting will force column names in the result 
# to be unique.

# data.frame converts each of its arguments to a data frame by 
# calling as.data.frame(optional = TRUE). As that is a generic 
# function, methods can be written to change the behaviour of 
# arguments according to their classes: R comes with many such 
# methods. Character variables passed to data.frame are converted 
# to factor columns unless protected by I or argument stringsAsFactors 
# is false. If a list or data frame or matrix is passed to data.frame 
# it is as if each component or column had been passed as a separate 
# argument (except for matrices protected by I).

# Objects passed to data.frame should have the same number of rows, 
# but atomic vectors (see is.vector), factors and character vectors 
# protected by I will be recycled a whole number of times if necessary 
# (including as elements of list arguments).

# If row names are not supplied in the call to data.frame, the row names 
# are taken from the first component that has suitable names, for example 
# a named vector or a matrix with rownames or a data frame. (If that 
# component is subsequently recycled, the names are discarded with a 
# warning.) If row.names was supplied as NULL or no suitable component 
# was found the row names are the integer sequence starting at one 
# (and such row names are considered to be ‘automatic’, and not 
# preserved by as.matrix).

# If row names are supplied of length one and the data frame has 
# a single row, the row.names is taken to specify the row names 
# and not a column (by name or number).

# Names are removed from vector inputs not protected by I.

# default.stringsAsFactors is a utility that takes 
# getOption("stringsAsFactors") and ensures the result 
# is TRUE or FALSE (or throws an error if the value is 
# not NULL). This function is deprecated now and will 
# no longer be available in the future.

# Value
# A data frame, a matrix-like structure whose columns may 
# be of differing types (numeric, logical, factor and 
# character and so on).

# How the names of the data frame are created is complex, 
# and the rest of this paragraph is only the basic story. 
# If the arguments are all named and simple objects (not 
# lists, matrices of data frames) then the argument names 
# give the column names. For an unnamed simple argument, 
# a deparsed version of the argument is used as the name 
# (with an enclosing I(...) removed). For a named matrix
# /list/data frame argument with more than one named column, 
# the names of the columns are the name of the argument 
# followed by a dot and the column name inside the argument: 
# if the argument is unnamed, the argument's column names 
# are used. For a named or unnamed matrix/list/data frame 
# argument that contains a single column, the column name 
# in the result is the column name in the argument. Finally, 
# the names are adjusted to be unique and syntactically 
# valid unless check.names = FALSE.

# Note
# In versions of R prior to 2.4.0 row.names had to be character: 
# to ensure compatibility with such versions of R, supply a 
# character vector as the row.names argument.
